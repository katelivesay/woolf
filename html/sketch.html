            <h1><u>Sketch of the Past</u></h1>

        <div class="summary">
            <p>Jacob's Room is the third novel by Virginia Woolf, first published on 26 October 1922.</p>

            <p>The novel centres, in a very ambiguous way, around the life story of the protagonist Jacob Flanders and is presented almost entirely through the impressions other characters have of Jacob. Thus, although it could be said that the book is primarily a character study and has little in the way of plot or background, the narrative is constructed with a void in place of the central character if, indeed, the novel can be said to have a 'protagonist' in conventional terms.</p>
                
            <p>Motifs of emptiness and absence haunt the novel and establish its elegiac feel. Jacob is described to us, but in such indirect terms that it would seem better to view him as an amalgam of the different perceptions of the characters and narrator. He does not exist as a concrete reality, but rather as a collection of memories and sensations.</p>

    <h1><u>A Sketch of the Past</u></h1>
    <h2>By Virginia Woolf</h2>
</div>

<div class="summary">
    <p>This essay consists of nearly 100 pages of Woolf's recollections of childhood, recorded journal-entry-style in 1939-40. It introduces Woolf's concept of “moments of being” and of “non-being,” the latter being the cotton wool in between the important stuff of life/memory. Interesting for organization (or lack thereof); for the layering of time, then and now; and for Woolf's list-making. It was also unfinished at the time of her death, and somewhat lacking in narrative structure.</p>

    <p>“A Sketch of the Past” is a series of memories of Woolf's childhood, related when she is nearly sixty. She begins by worrying over the format of these memoirs, then throwing up her hands to begin with “the first memory.” The form ends up being a sort of journal, with dated entries and a few comments on current events (the coming war). This layered-time effect allows commentary on both the past and the writing-present.</p>
    
    <p>Woolf's “moments of being” stand in contrast to what she calls “moments of non-being.” Woolf asks, “Why have I forgotten so many things that must have been, one would have thought, more memorable than what I do remember? … Often… I have been baffled by this same problem; that is, how to describe what I call in my private shorthand — 'non-being.' Every day includes much more non-being than being.” She likens non-being to cotton wool, or the everyday padding of what is remembered (or, what she wants to write about). She then goes on to call her moments of being “scaffolding in the background” of the real work of her storytelling: these are people, or characters. (The idea of moments of being, or characters, as the central work of storytelling is another concept for potential annotation.) </p>

    <p>“A Sketch of the Past” proceeds to study characters: Woolf’s mother, father, and a few siblings.</p>
